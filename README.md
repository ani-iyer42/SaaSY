# SASSY by Bubblegum
We need to come up with a better name.

A SaaS tool (web portal) that allows anyone to build a simple decision tree and deploy it in the form of a chat window on their own website. Most websites that sell a lot of products will be well served by a chat window on their home page. Marketing teams will be the intended audience so the solution should not require any coding. The final deployment step may require developer intervention and our aim is to make it as developer friendly as possible.
